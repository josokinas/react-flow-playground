## Get started

You will need Node 14 running locally.

### Install dependencies

**Install Node**

Use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/) to manage different Node versions, and switch between them.

To install and switch to a required version run:

    nvm install && nvm use

**Install local Node dependencies**

    npm install

### Development mode

    npm run develop

#### Lint code

    npm run lint

### Clean cache/build directories

    npm run clean

### Production mode

    npm run build

#### Serve built app

    npm run serve

#### Make a release

    npm run release

This will bump a version, also add a CHANGELOG entry based on commits between releases.
